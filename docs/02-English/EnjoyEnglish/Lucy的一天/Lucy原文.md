## 1、起床

On a weekday, I usually get up around 6:30 a.m., but I set my alarm to go off at 6:20 so that I can hit the snooze button to sleep another 10 minutes. My roommate thinks I'm crazy, but doing this in the mornings actually helps me wake up. I'm a night owl, not an early bird like she is, so I need an extra few minutes to get going in the morning.

One reason it’s so hard to get up is because my bedroom and my bed are so comfortable. I splurged and bought a bed with a very soft, thick mattress. I also have matching sheets and pillowcases, and a comforter that is made of goose down. Even my nightstand matches my sheets and the rest of my bedroom. I decorated it so that it would be restful after a busy day at work.

When I get up, the first thing I do is put on my robe. It's always so cold in the apartment in the mornings, no matter what time of year it is. Then, I usually make my bed. I hated making my bed when I was little, but now it's become a routine. Sometimes, though, I'm so tired that I sleep in for just a little too long and then, the bed definitely doesn' t get made. On those days, I wish I could sleep in all day!

工作日早上，我通常六点半左右起床，但是我把闹钟设在六点二十，这样我可以按一下“贪睡按钮”再睡十分钟。我舍友觉得我古怪。但是每天早上这样做可以帮我清醒过来。我不是夜猫子，但也不是她那样的早起鸟，所以我早上需要多睡几分钟再起床开始新的一天。

起床困难的一个原因就是我的卧室和床太舒服了。我花大价钱买了个床，床垫又软又厚。我也有配套的床单和枕套，还有厚鹅绒被子。就连我的床头柜也和我的床单还有卧室的其他部分很搭。我认真装饰了卧室，这样忙了一天的工作之后，回来可以好好休息。

起床之后，第一件事就是穿上睡袍。因为公寓里一年到头早上都很冷。然后，我会收拾床铺。我小时候就讨厌收拾床铺，但是现在这变成了例行程序。然而，有时我很累，就会多睡一会，然后就没空收拾床铺了!那时候，我很希望我可以睡一整天。

## 2、梳洗化妆

I share a bathroom with my roommate, which is usually not a problem. We each try to keep the sink, the tub, and the toilet clean, and we have separate medicine cabinets to keep our things. There’s also room under the sink for our hairdryers and tampons.

I start out by rinsing my mouth with some mouthwash before flossing. Then, I take out my toothbrush and toothpaste and brush my teeth. I only wash my hair every other day so I put on a shower cap and don’t have to get out my shampoo and conditioner. I like to take bubble baths when I have time, but on a busy morning, a shower will have to do. I lather up quickly and give my legs a quick shave.

I don’t wear a lot of make-up to work so I just put on a little blush and a light-colored lipstick, and skip the mascara and eye shadow. I put a few hot curlers in my hair and I’m ready for breakfast!

我和我室友共用卫生间，这也不成问题。我们用完洗手盆、浴缸还有马桶之后都会及时打扫，保证干净，药柜是分开的，可以自己放自己的东西。洗手盆下方也有地方可以放电吹风和卫生棉条。

我先用漱口水漱口，再用牙线清理牙齿。然后，我拿出牙刷牙膏开始刷牙。我每两天洗一次头，洗澡的时候戴上浴帽，也不用拿洗发水和护发素出来。有时间的时候我喜欢洗泡泡浴，但是早上时间很紧张，冲个澡就可以了。我打肥皂，刮腿毛都很快。

上班的时候我一般不化太浓的妆，只打一点点腮红，涂浅色的口红，不涂睫毛膏和眼影。在头发上卷几个卷发器就可以吃早餐啦！

## 3、吃早饭

In the kitchen, the first thing I do is pour myself a cup of coffee and I add a little skim milk and sugar. My roommate usually makes a pot when she wakes up for both of us since she gets up first.

I go the fridge to take out the eggs. When I have time, I like to cook a hot breakfast, so I take out the frying pan, pour a little oil in it, and turn on the front burner on the stovetop. While the eggs are cooking, I put two pieces of bread into the toaster. When the eggs are nice and brown on the edges, I use a spatula to put them on a plate. Some mornings, I have to settle for some cold cereal or just toast with jam, but it’s nice to start the day with a sit-down meal when I get the chance.

When I’m done, I take my plate and my silverware to the sink, where my roommate has left her breakfast dishes. Since she makes the coffee in the morning, I wash the dishes. It’s a pretty good arrangement. I put a little dishwashing detergent on the sponge, scrub the dishes, and leave them in the drying rack to dry.

走到厨房我先给自己倒一杯咖啡，加一点脱脂奶和糖。我室友起得早，所以她起来后会煮一壶咖啡。

有时间的时候我还是想做顿热饭。我到冰箱拿几个鸡蛋，拿出煎锅，倒一点油，打开炉子。鸡蛋在锅里煎着，我又往烤箱里放了两片面包。鸡蛋煎好了，边缘变成了棕色，我用铲子把它盛到盘子里。有时候早上我只能吃冷麦片和果酱夹吐司凑合一下，但是有机会的时候还是坐下来认真吃顿早饭比较好。

吃饱之后，我把我的盘子和镀银餐具拿到水池里，水池里有我室友吃早餐留下的盘子，我一块洗了。她早上煮了咖啡，我就洗碗，这个安排很合理。我在海绵上倒一点餐具洗涤剂，擦洗盘子，最后放在干燥架上晾干。

## 4、发型服饰

I go back into the bathroom to finish doing my hair.

Before I put the hot curlers in, I had put a little gel in my hair to give it some volume.

I also like to use my hairdryer to give my bangs a little more shape.

I take out the curlers one by one and brush through them into the style I like.

I finish it off with a little hairspray and I’m ready to get dressed.

In my bedroom, I look in my closet for a skirt and blouse to match.

The office I work in is pretty casual so I don’t need to wear a suit to work.

On Fridays, we’re allowed to be even more casual so most people wear jeans and sweaters to the office,

but no one dares to show up in t-shirts and shorts.

I put on the skirt and blouse and open the top dresser drawer to get some pantyhose.

I wish I could wear my tennis shoes to work, but I pick out a pair of heels and put them on.

I was ready to go.

我回到洗手间去完成发型的最后一步。

我往头发里放加热过的卷发器之前，往头发上抹了点发胶，让头发看起来更丰盈。

我还喜欢用吹风机给我的刘海塑塑型。

我把卷发器一个个取下来，把头发梳成想要的发型。

最后喷一点头发定型剂，就可以去穿衣服了。

我走到卧室，打开衣柜找出裙子和配套的衬衫。

我工作的地方比较随意，所以我不用穿套装去上班。

周五我们还可以穿得更随意一些，所以很多人穿牛仔裤和毛衣去上班，

不过没人敢穿T恤和短裤去上班。

我穿上裙子和衬衫，打开梳妆台最上边的抽屉拿出连裤袜。

真希望可以穿网球鞋去上班，但我只能挑双高跟鞋穿上。

然后就可以去上班啦。

## 5、乘坐公共交通工具去上班

I like my job but it takes over an hour to get there from my part of town.

First, I walk three blocks to the subway station and swipe my monthly pass to get through the turnstile.

I wait on the platform for the first express train.

I get on and since it's so crowded during the morning hours, there aren't any seats and I stand, holding onto a handrail.

At my stop, I get off and transfer to a second train that will get me to Union Station.

This one isn't as crowded and I manage to find a seat.

When the train gets to Union Station, I get off the train, go up the stairs, and go out of the front exit to the bus stop.

I get on the B bus to downtown and show my bus pass to the bus driver.

I sit down near the front of the bus and when three more people get on board, the driver starts on the route.

When we get close to my stop, I press the button to signal to the driver that I need to get off and the bus pulls up to the next stop.

I get off and walk half a block to the building where I work.

It's a long commute, but I look around every morning and I see that I'm not the only one who has to do it.

我喜欢我的工作，但从我这边到那里要花一个多小时。

首先，我要走三个街区到地铁站，然后刷月票通过旋转门。

我在站台上等第一辆特快列车。

上车之后，因为早高峰时段太挤了，没有座位，我只能抓着扶手站着。

到了我下车的那一站，我下车转乘第二辆火车，去联合车站。

这辆车没有那么拥挤，我终于找到一个座位。

列车到达联合车站时，我下了车，上楼梯，出了前门出口走到公共汽车站。

我乘B路公共汽车到市区，向巴士司机出示了公车月票。

我在公共汽车的前面坐了下来，这时又有三个人上车，然后司机发动汽车上路了。

快到我下车那一站的时候，我按下按钮，向司机示意我需要下车，然后公交车会停到下一站。

我下车，走了半个街区到我工作的地方。

通勤时间很长，但我每天早上都环顾四周，发现并不是只有我自己需要这么长时间。

## 6、工作与午餐

I get to the office and sit down at my desk.

I share a cubicle with another employee, Jim, but he only works in the afternoons so we don't usually get in each other's way too much.

I boot up my computer and look at my agenda for today.

I had about 30 new emails in my inbox but I decide not to read them right away.

There were some new inter-office paperwork in my inbox too, but I decide to look at them a little later.

First, I wanted to start in on a report that I had to finish today.

I had a conference call at the end of the day with the head office, but I had most of the day to get it done.

Before long, it was the lunch hour.

I didn't pack a lunch so I ask my supervisor if she wanted to have lunch together.

We head down the street to a sit-down restaurant.

The hostess shows us to a table in the back of the restaurant.

The waiter arrives a few minutes later and we order entrees, no appetizers, since we need to get back by 1:00.

The waiter was very busy so I had to wave him down to get the check.

He brought the bill, and my supervisor and I split the check.

We walk back to the office and I get back to work.

Just four more hours until quitting time!

我到办公室，坐在我的办公桌前。

我和另一个雇员吉姆共用一个小隔间，但他只在下午工作，这样我们就不会经常互相干扰。

我启动电脑，看看我今天的日程安排。

我的收件箱里有大约30封新邮件，但我决定不马上看。

我的收件箱里也有一些新的办公室间的文件，但我决定稍后再看。

首先，我想先完成一个今天必须完成的报告。

今天结束之前，我要给总部打一个电话，报告有关会议的事情。但我接下来的大半天都可以做这件事。

不久，就是午餐时间了。

我没有自带午餐，所以我问我的主管她是否想一起吃午饭。

我们沿着街道走到一个提供座位的餐馆。

女迎宾员带我们到餐厅后部的一张桌子。

几分钟后，服务员到了，我们点了主菜，没点开胃菜，因为我们需要在1点前赶回来。

服务员很忙，所以我不得不挥手让他结账。

他拿来了账单，主管和我平分账单。

我们走回办公室，回到工作岗位。

再过4个小时就可以下班了!

## 7、银行与市场

I left at work at exactly five o'clock because I wanted to make it to the bank before it closed at 5:30.

Fortunately, it's on the way to the bus stop.

I get to the bank and I stand in line.

I fill out a deposit envelope and sign the back of my paycheck while I wait my turn.

When I get to the front of the line,

I hand the teller the envelope and I ask her if she could tell how much I had in my account.

She told me my balance and handed me my receipt.

I ride the bus and the subway home.

I realize that I need a few things at the market and stop at one on the way there.

I pick up a cart as soon as I walk in and go to the produce department to load up on fruit, some apples and bananas.

I look around to see what kind of cooked foods they have.

I'm feeling lazy and I don't want to cook tonight.

I pick up a sandwich and I head for the checkout stands.

I get into the shortest line and the cashier rings me up.

She gives me my change and the bagger hands me my bags.

I walk the two blocks to my apartment and I'm ready for a relaxing evening at home.

我五点准时下班，因为我想在五点半关门前赶到银行。

幸运的是，它在去公共汽车站的路上。

我到了银行，然后排队。

我填写一个存款信封，在等待我的顺序时，在支票背面签名。

当轮到我时，

我把信封交给出纳员，我问她是否能告诉我，我的账户里有多少钱。

她把余额告诉了我，并把收据给了我。

我乘公共汽车和地铁回家。

我意识到我需要在市场上买些东西，于是在回家的路上找了个市场停下。

我一进去就拿起一辆手推车，到加工区去买水果，一些苹果和香蕉。

我环顾四周，看看他们有什么样的熟食。

我觉得有些懒，今晚不想做饭。

我拿起一个三明治，走向收款站。

我挑了个最短的队伍，收银员叫我过来。

她给我找钱，装袋工将购物袋递给我。

我步行两个街区到我的公寓，准备在家里度过一个轻松的夜晚。

## 8、晚餐与甜点

When I get home, I change into my casual clothes and head for the kitchen.

I grab my sandwich, a napkin, and sit down at the dining room table to eat.

For my birthday last year, my brother gave me some place mats that have maps of the United States on them.

I have always been bad at geography so he thought he would be funny and give me something to study while I ate.

Of course, I haven't learned a thing!

I am still hungry after the sandwich and want some dessert.

I preheat the oven and then take a package of ready-made cookies out of the fridge that just needed to be baked.

I get out a cookie sheet and put some aluminum foil on it.

I always do this when I bake because this way, I don't have to do any dishes afterwards.

I could just throw away the foil.

Then, I shape the dough into circles, put them on the cookie sheet, and put the pan into the oven.

After 15 minutes, I put on my oven mitts and take the pan out.

The cookies smell great, but first, I need to let them cool.

After 30 minutes, I put three of them on a plate and the rest of them in a Tupperware container.

I'll take those to work tomorrow.

That should make the day go by a little faster.

当我回到家时，我换上便服，走向厨房。

我拿起我的三明治，一张餐巾，坐在餐厅的桌子旁吃东西。

去年我生日时，我哥哥给了我几个垫子，上面画着美国地图。

我一向地理不好，所以他认为这会很有趣，在我吃饭的时候，让我学习一些东西。

当然，我没有学到东西！

吃完三明治，我还是很饿，想吃点甜点。

我预热烤箱，然后从冰箱里拿出一包现成的饼干，只需要烘烤就能食用。

我拿出一块饼干纸，在上面放了一些铝箔。

我烤的时候总是这样，因为这样，我就不用洗碗了。

我可以扔掉铝箔纸。

然后，我把面团揉成圆圈，放在饼干纸上，然后把烤盘放进烤箱里。

15分钟后，我戴上手套，把烤盘拿出来。

饼干闻起来很棒，但首先，我要让它们凉一凉。

30分钟后，我拿了三个，放在盘子里，其余的放在了一个特百惠收纳盒里。

我明天上班带着它们。

这样一天就能好过一点。

## 9、清洁与放松

I am feeling pretty energetic when I finish my three cookies and decide to do a little cleaning.

I take out a rag and start dusting the living room.

I dust the TV and the lamps. I wipe the coffee table, too.

The rug looked filthy so I get out the vacuum and vacuum it.

I pick up around the room and put things away.

The bathroom needs cleaning, too, but by this time, I am starting to feel tired.

Mopping the bathroom floor and scrubbing the tub will have to wait for another day.

I turn on the TV to watch the newscast, but I missed the national news.

I flip though the channels but all I see are commercials.

My favorite reality show doesn’t come on for another hour so I turn off the TV.

I put down the remote, and pick up a magazine.

I thumb through it for few minutes and then the phone rings.

It’s my best friend Marlene, so I put down the magazine and spend the half hour chatting with her.

There’s nothing like a good talk with a good friend to end a busy day.

吃完三块饼干后，我感到精力充沛，决定去打扫一下房间。

我拿出一块抹布，开始打扫起居室。

我掸掉电视和灯上的灰尘，然后擦了擦咖啡桌。

地毯看起来很脏，所以我用真空吸尘器清理了一下。

我收拾了一下屋子，把东西放好。

浴室也需要打扫，但这时，我觉得有点累了。

拖浴室地板，擦洗浴缸的活，不得不等到明天了。

我打开电视观看新闻节目，但是国内新闻已经结束了。

我换了几个频道，但全是商业广告。

我最喜欢的真人秀节目，再等一个小时也播不了，于是我关掉了电视。

放下遥控器，我拿起一本杂志。

刚翻了几分钟，电话就响了。

是我最好的朋友，马琳打来的，于是我放下杂志和她聊了半个小时。

忙了一天，最开心的事莫过于能和好朋友愉快地聊聊天了。



## 10、准备上床睡觉

I am feeling pretty tired by 11:00 and decide to get ready for bed.

I go into the bathroom to take off my make-up.

I use a cleanser to wash my face and dry it with a towel.

Then I put some toner on my face and then some moisturizer.

I comb my hair and tie it back.

I don't like getting hair in my face while I sleep so tying it back helps.

I floss and brush my teeth, and am ready for bed.

By this time, I am pretty beat.

I go into my bedroom and I get undressed.

I put the dirty clothes in the hamper and put on my pajamas.

I take off my slippers and pull back the covers.

I check my alarm to make sure it's on and then I lay down.

I have this same ritual every night, which I think helps me fall asleep more easily.

It's not long before I'm fast asleep.

到11点时，我非常疲惫，于是决定睡觉。

我去洗手间卸了妆。

用洗面奶洗了洗脸，然后用毛巾擦干。

随后，往脸上拍了些润肤水，抹了些护肤霜。

梳理了头发，并把它扎起来。

我不喜欢睡觉时把头发弄到脸上所以把它扎起来是不错的办法。

用牙线刷完牙后，我准备睡觉。

这时，我累极了。

我在卧室脱掉衣服，

把他们放在脏衣篮里，穿上了我的睡衣。

脱掉拖鞋，然后拉开被子。

我检查了闹钟，确定它是开着的，然后就躺下来。

每天晚上都做同样的事情，我想这样会有助于更容易入睡。

不久我就睡着了。
