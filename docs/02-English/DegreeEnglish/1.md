While like most music festivals, it boasted（自豪） an ==impressive== and ==diverse== music, there was something extra special about this one. You see, this was a green festival!

​		我==最近==有机会去参加我的第一个音乐节。“我们爱绿色”活动于周末在巴黎巴加特尔广场==举行==。虽然像大多数音乐节一样，它以==令人印象深刻==和==多样化==的音乐而自豪，但这次音乐节有一些特别之处。你看，这是一个绿色的节日!

2. What is the special about the music festival? 这个音乐节有什么特别之处?

   B. It has ==a unique== program list 它有==独特的==节目单

   **D**. it is environmentally friendly. 它是环保的	

​		From the food to the stalls(货摊）, everything was as environmentally friendly as ==possible==. Not only was the majority of the furniture/stalls/==toilet rooms== ==hand-made== from wood, the festival was powered by ==solar energy==. ==Guests== were invited to dispose（把） of ==rubbish== in specially labeled ==dustbins== which, after the festival, were ==sorted== so all of the ==waste== could be recycled ==appropriately==. ==Fresh water== was made available freely to everyone so that ==attendants== were not ==encouraged== to buy drinks in plastic bottles which would have created a lot of ==waste==.

​		从食物到摊位，一切都==尽可能地==环保。不仅大部分家具/摊位/==厕所==都是用木头==手工制作==的，而且节日是由==太阳能==供电的。==客人们==被邀请把==垃圾==扔进特殊标记的==垃圾箱==里，在节日结束后，这些垃圾箱被==分类==，以便所有的==垃圾==都能得到==适当的==回收。每个人都可以免费获得==淡水==，这样==服务员==就不会被==鼓励==去买塑料瓶装的饮料，那样会造成很多==浪费==。

3. At the music festival, ==guests== were ==encouraged== to _ . 在音乐节上，==客人们==被==鼓励==

   A. make ==furniture== form wood 用木材制作==家具==

   B. bring plastic-bottle ==drinks== 带上塑料瓶==饮料==

   D. drink free fresh water

​		I ==found== the experience ==incredibly fun== but also really ==interesting==. Having never been to a music festival before, I was ==unsure== of what to ==expect==. However, I was happy to find myself sitting i a field eating a healthy, ==home-made== fruit cake while drinking organic（有机） ==fruit juice==. There were many stalls, ==art installations==, and different areas, meaning ==there was something there for everyone==, from small children to the elderly!

​		我==觉得==这次经历==非常有趣==，但也确实==有趣==。以前从未参加过音乐节，我==不确定==会==发生==什么。然而，我很高兴地发现自己坐在田野里，一边吃着健康的==家里做的==水果蛋糕，一边喝着有机==果汁==。这里有很多摊位、==艺术装置==和不同的区域，这意味着从小孩到老人，==每个人都有适合自己的东西==！

4. ==According== to ==paragraph== 3, the author _ . ==根据==第三==段==，作者

   A. fully enjoyed the festival 充分享受这个节日

   B. ==expected much== from the festival 对这个节日==期望很高==

   **C**. ==found== the event ==very funny== ==觉得==这个活动==很有趣==

   D. liked listening music at home

​		This seems like such a great idea, making something ==very fun and interesting==, that does not cause great damage to the environment. I have since ==discovered== that there are more events ==similar== to this ==across the globe==, which is great! ==can' t imagine== how much ==waste== has been produced from such public events as festivals ==across the years== before we realized（意识到） ==just how bad== they were for the environment!

​		这==看来==好像是一个很棒的想法，让一些东西变得==非常有趣==，而且不会对环境造成很大的破坏。从那以后，我==发现==有更多==类似的==事件在==全球范围==内，这太棒了! ==无法想象==，在我们意识到节日等公共活动对环境==有多么糟糕==之前，这些年来已经产生了多少==废品==!

### Passage Two    Anger and the Ways to Cope with it

- unless 除非、lead to 导致、heart disease 心脏病
- stomach problems 胃部问题、headaches 头痛
- emotional problems 情绪问题、breast cancer 乳腺癌

​		Anger is a normal emotion that we all feel ==from time to time==. Some people ==express== anger openly in a ==calm and reasonable way==. Others ==burst== with anger, ==screaming and yelling==. But still others keep their anger inside. They cannot or will not express it. This is called <u>repressing</u> anger.

- from time to time 时不时地、express 表达
- calm and reasonable way 冷静和合理的方式
- burst 爆发、screaming and yelling 大喊大叫
- keep their anger inside 把他们的愤怒藏在心里
- called 叫做、repressing 压抑

1. In Paragraph 2, "repressing" means _ .
   A. releasing 释放
   **B**. suppressing 抑制
   C. expressing
   D. reasoning 推理

​		For years some doctors ==claim== that both repressing and expressing anger can be dangerous. They say that in both ==situations== the brain of an angry person ==releases== the same hormones(荷尔蒙）.

- claim 声称、situations 情况、releases 释放

    D.expressing anger would produce higher level of hormones than repressing it

​		They ==speed== the heart rate, raise blood pressure or sugar level in the blood. As a result, the angry person
feels ==excited== and is ready to react. The ==violent reaction== may lead to high blood pressure. However, some other doctors argue that repressing anger more dangerous to a person's health than expressing it. They believe that those who keep theit anger inside may face a greater danger of heart disease.

- speed（v 表示：促进、加速）
- heart rate 心率、raise blood pressure or sugar level in the blood 升高血压或血糖水平
- excited 激动的、兴奋的
- violent reaction 剧烈反映

​		Most doctors agree that it is important to learn how to deal with anger. They say the first step is to ==admit== that you are angry and ==recognize== the real cause of the anger, then ==decide== if the cause is ==serious== enough to get angry about. ==If so==, do not express your anger ==immediately==. ==Wait until== your anger has cooled down and you are able to express yourself calmly and ==reasonably==. They also believe that a good way to deal with anger is to find ==humor== in the situation that has made you angry. After all, it is much healthier to laugh than to get angry.

- admit 承认、允许
- recognize 识别、确认、认识
- recognize the real cause of the anger 认识到你生气的真正原因、decide 决定、serious 严重
- If so 如果是这样的话、immediately 立即、马上
- Wait until 直到、reasonably 合理
