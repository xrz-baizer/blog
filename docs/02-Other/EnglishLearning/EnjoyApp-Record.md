**Today is Thursday, August 1st.**




**After a week of rain, the weather's finally clearing up.**




**I was starting to doubt if Shenzhen is really livable.**



**The forecast says it'll be sunny this weekend,**



**so I'm planning to visit my mom.**



**It's been a while since I saw her, and I miss her.**



**I'm thinking of going this Saturday.**



**We'll have lunch together and then go hiking.**



**Mom has an electric scooter, so getting to the hike will be easy.**



**Not sure about dinner yet; we'll decide later.**

**Today is August 2nd, and it's Friday.**



**I'm a bit excited since the weekend is almost here.**



**But something unexpected happened today.**



**During lunch, my iPhone 13 Pro suddenly went white screen and became unresponsive.**



**I had no choice but to ask my colleagues for help.**



**I needed someone to call me a cab to the nearest Apple repair center**



**or lend me some cash so I could get there myself.**



**Luckily, one of my colleagues had some cash on hand—one 50-yuan note and one 20-yuan note.**



**After getting approval from my boss, I went downstairs and flagged a taxi.**



**I asked the driver how much it would cost to get to the repair center, and he said 20 yuan.**



**What a coincidence.**



**Once I got to the Apple repair center, I waited in line for about 5 minutes.**



**The staff asked if I had an appointment, and I said no,**



**so I had to make one on the spot.**



**After waiting another 15 minutes, it was finally my turn.**



**The technician checked my phone and said the screen needed to be replaced.**



**It would cost 2300 yuan, which is pretty steep.**



**But what can you do? Going to a small shop might cost around 1000 yuan,**



**but there's a risk involved.**



**The staff gave me a repair slip and told me to come back in an hour.**



**I hurried back to work, taking the subway for two stops.**



**I didn't take a taxi because it costs 20 yuan, while the subway is just 2 yuan.**



**After returning to the office, I wrote this journal entry.**



**Now, all I can do is wait until 6 PM to pick up my phone from the repair center.**



**I hope they fix it properly.**




**Living without a phone in the 21st century is tough!**



**Once it's fixed, I plan to take my bank card and ID to an ATM to withdraw some cash.**



**I'll keep some in my bag for emergencies.**



**I also need to think about getting a backup phone.**



## 2024-08-22

**Today is Thursday, August 22nd.**



**I'm writing this diary during my morning downtime at work.**



**It's another Thursday, but tonight we have a release, so I might be up late.**



**Last Sunday afternoon, I bought a ceramic mug on Taobao.**



**Unbelievably, it's Thursday now, and it still hasn't shipped.**



**If it doesn't ship soon, I won't give the seller another chance.**




**I just used a calculator to figure out my age.**



**By the end of October, I'll be 27.**



**I'm still single and need to find someone.**



**I used to focus on myself, investing time and energy in me.**



**But as I get older, I feel a bit lost and directionless.**



**I have a general goal, but no drive to move forward.**



**Work and study drain all my energy, making me want to just relax.**



**Maybe finding someone could give me the motivation I need.**



**I shouldn't waste my youth like this.**



**Well, it's not really wasted, but it could be better spent.**



**I'm 26 now, and it will be harder to find someone in my early 30s.**



**Even if I do, it takes time to build a relationship, maybe 2 or 3 years.**



**By then, I'll be 30.**



**After 30, for someone from a not-so-great family like mine, chances get slimmer.**



**So, while I'm still young, I need to step up and take action!**



**As our company motto says: "The difference between being proactive and not is 30 times the life resources!"**
